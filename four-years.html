		<h1>Four Years of OTC</h1>

		<main id="main-content">
			<p class="extra-bottom-margin">
				Date: 24<sup>th</sup> January 2024
			</p>

			<p class="extra-bottom-margin">Dear members,</p>

			<p class="extra-bottom-margin">
				I am delighted to announce that Our Tech Community has completed
				four years since its inception! To commemorate this occasion, we
				held an in-person meetup,
				<a
					href="https://meetup.ourtech.community/4"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noreferrer"
					>OTC MeetUp #4</a
				>, where alongside technical lightning talks, I recapped some of
				OTC's activities throughout these four years, gave my thanks to
				our team and members, and talked about our future plans. I'll
				sum up OTC's four years here as well.
			</p>

			<p>Our notable events in the last four years:</p>
			<ul class="extra-bottom-margin">
				<li>
					OTC CatchUp

					<div>
						<ul>
							<li>
								These are weekly informal online Tech
								discussions with project showcases and technical
								debates.
							</li>
							<li>
								We've conducted 167 consecutive weekly sessions
								till date, which translates to conducting these
								sessions
								<b>weekly for over 3.2 years without a break</b
								>!
							</li>
							<li>
								We've had over 800 hours of learning and fun
								till date!
							</li>
							<li>
								We also diligently maintained
								<a
									href="https://catchup.ourtech.community/summary"
									target="_blank"
									rel="noreferrer"
									>summaries for each session</a
								>.
							</li>
							<li>
								<a
									href="https://catchup.ourtech.community/attend"
									target="_blank"
									rel="noreferrer"
									>Attend a session!</a
								>
							</li>
						</ul>

					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					OTC MeetUp

					<div>
						<ul>
							<li>
								These are in-person Tech meetups to learn
								through technical talks and conversations.
							</li>
							<li>
								We've conducted four official in-person meetups
								till date, with over 70 attendees each!
							</li>
							<li>
								We would like to thank
								<a
									href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/preetjdp"
									target="_blank"
									rel="noreferrer"

									Preet Parekh</a
								>
								and the

					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					OTC Talks

					<div>
						<ul>
							<li>
								These are online technical talks held before OTC
								CatchUp.
							</li>
							<li>
								The aim is to encourage people to give 15 to 60
								minute talks on technical topics. It also
								provides a good starting point for the OTC
								CatchUp discussion to start.
							</li>
							<li>
								<a
									href="https://talks.ourtech.community/#past-talks"
									target="_blank"
									rel="noreferrer"
									>We've held five such talks till date.</a
								>
							</li>
							<li>
								Going forward, we want to conduct these talks
								once a month and have deeper technical content.
							</li>
							<li>
								Feel free to
								<a
									href="https://talks.ourtech.community/cfp"
									target="_blank"
									rel="noreferrer"
									>fill the CFP</a
								>
								to give a talk and do share it with people who
								you think might be interested!

					Unofficial meetups

					<div>
						<ul>

				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="extra-bottom-margin">
				All in all, I think we have done amazing work in these last four
				years, put in a lot of effort and have shown consistency and
				dedication towards conducting hundreds of events and keeping
				them as organic and Tech-focused as we can. We have been able to
				conduct these events, learn from them and build friendships,
				mainly because of two sets of people. One set is the people who
				attend our events and the other set is the OTC team. I briefly
				want to express my gratitude to all these inspiring people.
			</p>

			<p>Our attendees and members:</p>
			<p class="extra-bottom-margin">
				Thank you so much for attending our events, and for giving your
				time, knowledge, experience, advice and energy to everyone at
				our events. We all have built genuine bonds with each other and
				have learnt a lot from each other. We have all collectively
				helped each other be better and that makes me immensely proud. I
				feel so grateful to realise that we have an atmosphere in OTC
				where we all want each other to progress and have each other's
				backs when things aren't going well. That, I believe, is the
				strength of Our Tech Community and what indeed makes it
				<i>our</i> tech community.
			</p>

			<p>The OTC Team:</p>
			<p>
				There are six people who help OTC run smoothly. I cannot thank
				the team enough for putting in so much effort towards the
				community and for inspiring me to be better. The community
				wouldn't exist without their hard work. A lot of their
				principles have shaped the community and how we decide to go
				about doing things, which I have learnt from and am immensely
				proud of. We know each other well and have learnt to complement
				each other and work together. I am incredibly thankful and
				grateful to have these people in my life as friends and as OTC's
				team members.

				<li>
					Darshan Rander
					<br />

					Darshan is an Organiser at OTC alongside me. He has put in
					immense efforts into OTC right since it started. He takes a
					lot of initiative to do things and shows a lot of
					enthusiasm. He finds things to be done to achieve something
					and keeps at it till there is some resolution. When I had to
					move to the USA for the foreseeable future, I did not have
					to think for more than a minute to find someone who could
					handle things in India and take initiative on their own.
					Apart from admiring Darshan for his work with OTC, I have
					noticed that he is a good coder and also writes great poems!
				</li>
				<li>
					Dheeraj Lalwani
					<br />

					Dheeraj is an Admin with OTC and has again been there since
					the start of OTC. He has been a regular at OTC CatchUp and
					has contributed to OTC in multiple ways, be it writing
					summaries, handling social media, helping with planning and
					organisation, and more.
				</li>
				<li>
					Kartik Soneji
					<br />

					Kartik is an Admin at OTC and is a class apart in terms of
					his technical skills and principles. He has been there with
					us since OTC started and has imparted a lot of his
					principles and experience to help everyone around him be
					better.
				</li>
				<li>
					Pranav Dani
					<br />

					Pranav is an Admin at OTC and has been a regular at OTC
					CatchUp since the initial sessions. He mainly helps us with
					summaries and social media apart from other things. He has
					good knowledge of hardware, which we have benefitted and
					learnt from.
				</li>
				<li>
					Tushar Nankani
					<br />

					Tushar is an Admin at OTC and has worn multiple hats. He is
					great at communication, planning and organisation. He again
					has good principles and has handled a lot of difficult
					situations with maturity. He oversees OTC Talks sessions and
					is also responsible for most of our designing work, amongst
					other things.

				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="extra-bottom-margin">
				We have conducted a lot of events, we have a great set of people
				attending our events, a great team working tirelessly behind the
				scenes and a supportive environment to grow. We're all extremely
				grateful to have all this. Thank you! Let us now look at our
				plans for OTC going ahead.
			</p>

			<p>Our future plans:</p>
			<ul class="extra-bottom-margin">
				<li>
					At OTC, we have always kept a focus on Technical content.
					From now on, we will try to present deeper technical content
					and we plan to do that through OTC Talks.
				</li>
				<li>
					OTC Talks will be an area of focus. We will try to conduct
					one session per month and bring in speakers to talk deeply
					about a particular topic. If you know anyone, please
					<a
						href="https://links.ourtech.community"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noreferrer"
						>get in touch with us</a
					>!
				</li>
				<li>
					With OTC CatchUp, we will try to automate our summary
					writing process using some AI tool to generate a summary on
					the fly that we can edit after the session.
				</li>
				<li>
					I wanted to get more people from the USA involved with OTC.
					We don't have a specific plan for this yet, but if anyone
					has any ideas,
					<a
						href="https://links.harshkapadia.me"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noreferrer"
						>I'm all ears</a
					>!
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Our ask:</p>
			<p>
				Our events are open to all and aim to teach, help and foster
				genuine connections between people. We have mainly been focused
				on learning and thus rely mainly on our attendees to ask their
				friends and acquaintances to attend our events. Word-of-mouth
				publicity is the way a lot of people join us and we believe that
				although slow, this is a more organic way to have people attend
				our events and leads to better bonds between all of us as well.
				So,
				<b
					>if you like any of our events and learn something from
					them, we request you to ask your friends to join us for some
					of our events</b
				>, hang around for a bit and talk to people! We're sure they
				will enjoy and learn a lot with OTC!
			</p>
			<p class="extra-bottom-margin">
				We also wanted to remind everyone that we are on the lookout for
				people who are willing to give 15 to 60 minute-long deeper
				technical talks, so if anyone knows someone who might be
				interested, please
				<a
					href="https://links.ourtech.community"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noreferrer"
					>reach out to us</a
				>
				and
				<a
					href="https://talks.ourtech.community/cfp"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noreferrer"
					>fill the CFP</a
				>! It would be of great help!
			</p>

			<p class="extra-bottom-margin">
				In conclusion, I want to thank our attandees and members, and
				the OTC team. I am proud of everything we all have done
				together. We will try our best to do even better moving forward
				and I hope you
				<a
					href="https://links.ourtech.community"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer"
					>join us</a
				>
				for the journey!
			</p>

			<p class="extra-bottom-margin">Thank you!</p>
