	<h1>OTC's Code of Conduct</h1>

	<main id="main-content">

		<h2 id="our-pledge">Our Pledge</h2>
		<p>
			We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make
			participation in our community a harassment-free experience for
			everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible
			disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and
			expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic
			status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color,
			religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
		</p>
		<p>
			We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an
			open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.
		</p>

		<h2 id="our-standards">Our Standards</h2>
		<p>Examples of <strong>acceptable behavior</strong> include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.</li>
			<li>Accommodating for people with disabilities.</li>
			<li>Abide by the rules of the community and event.</li>
			<li>
				Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints and
				experiences.
			</li>
			<li>Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.</li>
			<li>
				Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected
				by our mistakes and learning from the experience.
			</li>
			<li>
				Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but
				for the overall community.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Examples of <strong>unacceptable behavior</strong> include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Not co-operating with the organising team.</li>
			<li>
				The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual
				attention or advances of any kind.
			</li>
			<li>Repeatedly flouting event rules.</li>
			<li>
				The use of derogatory or discriminatory words, sentiments or
				statements against any race, gender, sexuality and/or
				religion.
			</li>
			<li>
				Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or
				political attacks.
			</li>
			<li>Public or private harassment.</li>
			<li>
				Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical
				or email address, without their explicit permission.
			</li>
			<li>
				Other conduct which could reasonably be considered
				inappropriate in a professional setting.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		<p>In addition to these rules of conduct, everyone participating in events is encouraged to abide by the <a
				target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.recurse.com/social-rules">Recurse Center's Social
				Rules</a>:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>No well-actually's</li>
			<li>No feigning surprise</li>
			<li>No backseat driving</li>
			<li>No subtle -isms</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The social rules name subtle behaviors that put other people down or show how much we know instead of
			supporting each other’s learning.
			One thing that often surprises people about the social rules is that we expect people to break them from
			time to time. We’re all human, and we all make mistakes. The social rules are a guide to help us be better,
			not a list of things we’re not allowed to do.</p>

		<h2 id="enforcement-responsibilities">
			Enforcement Responsibilities
		</h2>
		<p>
			Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing
			our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate
			and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they
			deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
		</p>
		<p>
			Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove,
			edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and
			other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of
			Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions
			when appropriate.
		</p>
		<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
		<p>
			This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and
			also applies when an individual is officially representing the
			community in public spaces. Examples of representing our
			community include using an official e-mail address, posting via
			an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
			representative at an online or offline event.
		</p>

		<h2 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h2>
		<p>
			Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable
			behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible
			for enforcement at
			<a href="mailto:contact@ourtech.community">contact@ourtech.community</a>. All complaints will be reviewed
			and investigated promptly and
			fairly.
		</p>
		<p>
			All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and
			security of the reporter of any incident.
		</p>

		<h2 id="enforcement-guidelines">Enforcement Guidelines</h2>
		<p>
			Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines
			in determining the consequences for any action they deem in
			violation of this Code of Conduct:
		</p>
		<h3 id="1-correction">1. Correction</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>Community Impact</strong>: Use of inappropriate language
			or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the
			community.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Consequence</strong>: A private, written warning from
			community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the
			violation and an explanation of why the behavior was
			inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.
		</p>
		<h3 id="2-warning">2. Warning</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>Community Impact</strong>: A violation through a single
			incident or series of actions.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Consequence</strong>: A warning with consequences for
			continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved,
			including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code
			of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes
			avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external
			channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a
			temporary or permanent ban.
		</p>
		<h3 id="3-temporary-ban">3. Temporary Ban</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>Community Impact</strong>: A serious violation of
			community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Consequence</strong>: A temporary ban from any sort of
			interaction or public communication with the community for a
			specified period of time. No public or private interaction with
			the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
			those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this
			period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.
		</p>
		<h3 id="4-permanent-ban">4. Permanent Ban</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>Community Impact</strong>: Demonstrating a pattern of
			violation of community standards, including sustained
			inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or
			aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

			<strong>Consequence</strong>: A permanent ban from any sort of
			public interaction within the community.
