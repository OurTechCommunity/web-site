		<h1>Three Years of OTC</h1>

		<main id="main-content">
			<p>Date: 24<sup>th</sup> January 2023</p>

			<p>Dear members,</p>

			<p>
				I am happy and proud to announce that today marks three years
				since <a href="/">Our Tech Community</a>'s inception! What a
				journey it has been!
			</p>

			<p>
				Some of
				<a
					href="https://events.ourtech.community"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noreferrer"
					>the events we conducted</a
				>
				in our third year:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>OTC CatchUp</strong>: We continued our weekly
					<a
						href="https://catchup.ourtech.community"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noreferrer"
						>OTC CatchUp</a
					>
					sessions and have
					<b>conducted 115 consecutive weekly sessions</b> at this
					point, which means that we have
					<b>conducted over 800 hours of CatchUp sessions</b>! We have
					maintained
					<a
						href="https://catchup.ourtech.community/summary"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noreferrer"
						>summaries of the sessions</a
					>
					as well! This has been a mammoth effort and all the credits
					go to <a href="/team">the OTC team</a>. These informal
					technical discussion and project showcase sessions have
					fostered a lot of learning and friendships, which is what we
					have always desired to achieve.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>OTC MeetUp</strong>: As per
					<a
						href="https://ourtech.community/two-years#:~:text=start%20offline%20meetups"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noreferrer"
						>what we promised last year</a
					>, we started with in-person
					<a
						href="https://meetup.ourtech.community"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noreferrer"
						>OTC MeetUp</a
					>
					events and have
					<b>conducted two offline events with ~65 people each</b> at
					this point. The entire team worked tirelessly to plan and
					manage the events. We would like to thank
					<a
						href="https://twitter.com/TmPreet"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noreferrer"
						>Preet Parekh</a
					>
					for his help. We had a lot of good technical talks,
					technical panel discussions, one-on-one conversations and
					fun!
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>GDG DevFest Mumbai 2022</strong>: We were approached
					to be
					<a

						target="_blank"
						rel="noreferrer"

					>
					for one of Mumbai's biggest in-person Technical community
					events with ~800 attendees, the

						target="_blank"
						rel="noreferrer"
						>GDG DevFest Mumbai</a
					>! We were grateful to be able to help the Organisers and
					learn more about organising events on such a huge scale.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>In-person meets</strong>: We had a lot of other
					informal in-person meets to learn from and have fun with

			<p>
				This year, <a href="/team">our team</a> underwent changes.
				<a
					href="https://darshanrander.com"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noreferrer"
					>Darshan</a
				>
				became an Organiser, and
				<a href="https://pranavdani.me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
					>Pranav</a
				>
				and
				<a
					href="https://tusharnankani.com"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noreferrer"
					>Tushar</a
				>
				joined us as Admins!
				<a
					href="https://blog.harshkapadia.me/2022/realisations"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noreferrer"
					>A few months in 2022 were particularly challenging for
					me</a
				>
				and I was hardly able to contribute to OTC. The reason that OTC
				ran smoothly despite that is because of the efforts of the
				entire team comprising of my friends
				<a
					href="https://darshanrander.com"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noreferrer"
					>Darshan</a
				>,
				<a
					href="https://twitter.com/DhiruCodes"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noreferrer"
					>Dheeraj</a
				>,
				<a
					href="https://twitter.com/KartikSoneji_"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noreferrer"
					>Kartik</a
				>,
				<a href="https://pranavdani.me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
					>Pranav</a
				>
				and
				<a
					href="https://tusharnankani.com"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noreferrer"
					>Tushar</a
				>, who went over and above their responsibilities to keep the
				community going. I will always be very grateful for them and
				their love for OTC. I am so proud of all of them. They have
				inspired and taught me so much!
			</p>

			<p>
				Obviously, none of this would have even been possible without
				our 450+ members and the people who have attended and continue
				to attend our sessions. The entire team feels thankful, humbled
				and grateful for all the support that we have received. It gives
				us the motivation to keep improving and being better than
				ourselves.
				<a
					href="https://blog.darshanrander.com/posts/diary/otc-and-me"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noreferrer"
					>We have all grown, found good connections and have had
					really good laughs as well.</a
				>
			</p>

			<p>
				We had a brief period of reflecting on the future of OTC this
				year, and
				<a href="https://oberai.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
					>Aditya Oberai</a
				>
				helped us by giving us pointers to have an honest conversation.
				Some of the topics were along the lines of looking at the future
				of OTC, Growth and Scaling, being aware of agendas, setting
				agendas and Communication. The conclusion for most of them was
				to keep things as natural, organic and genuine as possible, as
				we have always aimed to. This conversation helped us look at
				things clearly, be on the same page, accept each other's
				differences and reinforce our principles.
			</p>

			<p>
				Our goals are to foster genuine connections between people and
				to keep our sessions Technology-focused. This is what we have
				been doing and will continue to do. We are trying to keep things
				as natural, genuine, inclusive and organic as we can.
			</p>

			<p>
				On the technical management side of things, we have been
				actively improving and maintaining our web sites, web apps and
				projects, especially
				<a
					href="https://github.com/OurTechCommunity/catchup"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noreferrer"
					>the <code>catchup</code> project</a
				>. We have had community members chip in to help us out as well,
				which is highly appreciated. We are always open to
				contributions!
				<a
					href="https://github.com/OurTechCommunity"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noreferrer"
					>Check us out on GitHub.</a
				>
			</p>

			<p>
				Moving forward, our plans are to continue
				<a
					href="https://catchup.ourtech.community"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noreferrer"
					>OTC CatchUp</a
				>, hold regular
				<a
					href="https://talks.ourtech.community"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noreferrer"
					>OTC Talks</a
				>
				sessions and conduct more in-person
				<a
					href="https://meetup.ourtech.community"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noreferrer"
					>OTC MeetUp</a
				>
				events. We are open to feedback and suggestions. I hope you all
				will
				<a
					href="https://links.ourtech.community"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noreferrer"
					>be a part of OTC</a
				>
				and its upcoming activities!
			</p>

			<p>Thank you.</p>
